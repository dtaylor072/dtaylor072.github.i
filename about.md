I'm David Taylor, an undergrad student at Vanderbilt University studying Math and Scientific Computing. I've built this site as a place for me to document the things that I'm working on and thinking about, specifically within the realms of data science and mathematics. I'm hoping that this site's existence will motivate me to work more on exploration outside of the classroom as well as improve my skills in writing about technical topics. If you're interested in chatting about anything you've seen on this site, feel free to reach out to me at [dtaylor072 (at) gmail (dot) com](mailto:dtaylor072@gmail.com).
