### $p$-Wasserstein Metric Proof:
First, we'll prove a result referenced in the previous post which essentially states that the $p$-Wasserstein metric is indeed a metric under certain conditions. That is, it satisfies the properties of non-negativity and reflexivity, as well as the triangle inequality. This theorem was originally proven by Cedric Villani in his 2003 book entitled "Topics in Optimal Transport" [Theorem 7.3].  

Here is our set-up: let $\Omega$ be a polish space endowed with a metric $D$, and let $p \in \mathbb{R}^+$. Then, define the cost function $c$ as such: $c(x,y) := D(x,y)^p$ and let $\mathcal{T}_p(\mu, \nu)$ be the cost of the optimal tranport plan of moving $\mu$ to $\nu$ on $\Omega$ (it is known that such a plan must exist on a Polish space, but we will not prove that here). We then have that $W_p = \mathcal{T}_p^{1/p}$, and recall that $W_p(\mu, \nu) := \Big(\inf_{P \in \Pi(\mu, \nu)}{\int_{\Omega \times \Omega}{D(x,y)^pP(dx,dy)}}\Big)^{1/p}$. Let $\mathcal{P}_p(\Omega)$ be the set of all probability measures on $\Omega$ with finite $p$-th moments. We can now state the theorem formally:  

__Theorem__: _For every $p \geq 1$, $W_p =  \mathcal{T}_p$ defines a metric on $\mathcal{P}_p(\Omega)$. i.e.,_

1. $W_p \geq 0$
2. $W_p(\mu, \nu) = 0$ _iff_ $\mu = \nu$
3. $\forall (\mu, \nu, \omega) \in \mathcal{P}_p(\Omega)$, $W_p(\mu, \omega) \leq W_p(\mu, \nu) + W_p(\nu, \omega)$.


_Proof:_ (Omitted, for now)
