### Post Overview:
In this post I'll be summarizing a web development project that I recently completed. The end product is a heatmap, built with [D3.js](https://d3js.org), in which a sequential color map is used to visually encode the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in each US state each day. The live project can be viewed at [https://covis-19.herokuapp.com](https://covis-19.herokuapp.com), and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/dtaylor072/CoVis).

### Motivation:
The coronavirus has been wreaking havoc in countries all over the world in the past several months and, recently, the US has become the nation with the most confirmed cases. While many of those confirmed cases have been in New York state (~38% at the time of writing), other US states have seen the disease begin to spread more rapidly within their communities in the latter half of March. Because New York's population is so large compared to those of other states, it is natural to wonder about how the rate of growth per capita in a given state stacks up against the rest of the nation. This visualization is meant to serve as a tool that one may use to compare the growth rate of Covid-19 spread across the 50 US states and the District of Columbia. To that end, this heatmap encodes newly confirmed Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in each US state for each day since March 7th, 2020.

I should state that this is one of many lenses through which one may view the spread of the coronavirus. Notably, the folks over at the New York Times have built out some awesome visualizations (see [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) and [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/upshot/coronavirus-metro-area-tracker.html)) with D3 that depict the current state of the virus spread in the US in several different ways. But as I am only one person and they are presumably a small army of front-end developers working around the clock, I will have to make do with my one heatmap.

### Data:
The data encoded in the heatmap is coincidintally from The New York Times, who opted several days ago to make public the [database](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) of Covid-19 cases in the US that they have been curating over the past several months. I was excited to get the notification that the NYT had published their data because I, like many, have found large inconsistencies and gaps in the data sources from different reporting agencies. The NYT has done the dirty work of monitoring news sources and health agencies in each state to get figures that are as accurate as possible. The dataset contains the number of confirmed cases and fatalities in each state on each day since the first case was recorded in the state.

The state population figures used are sourced from the US Census Bureau's [2019 population estimates](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/data-sets.html). The metric encoded in the heatmap is simply the number of newly confirmed cases in a given state on a given day, multiplied by 100,000 and divided by the total state population. This gives us the number of newly confirmed cases per 100,000 population in each state each day.

### Infrastucture:
I decided to use a Flask app to serve up the D3 to the front-end. I made this choice because it's incredibly simple to create a basic Flask application with Python and Flask plays nice with Heroku, which I use to host the application. The Flask app (`app.py`) is as simple as this:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify
from grab_data import retrieve_data

START_DATE = '2020-03-07'
URL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv'

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/data')
def data():
    data = retrieve_data(URL, START_DATE)
    return jsonify(data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

The index function renders the `index.html` file, which contains a bit of CSS styling for the chart and then several CDN links (to `D3.js` v5, `d3-legend.js`, `d3-tip.js`, and then the script which draws the visualization, `vis.js`). The `vis.js` script calls the '/data' endpoint which, in turn, calls the `retrieve_data` function within `grab_data.py`. This is a basic function which uses [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to retrieve the data from the NYT Github repo, and then pandas to shape, clean, and enhance the dataset. The source code for this function can be found [here](https://github.com/dtaylor072/CoVis/blob/master/grab_data.py). This line in `vis.js` retrieves the data returned by the 'data/' endpoint:
```js
const data = await d3.json('/data');
```
And, just like that, the data is loaded into the static JS and used to render the heatmap. The application is run in a Heroku [dyno](https://www.heroku.com/dynos) (linux container), which sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity. It's important to note that, each time the page is refreshed, the app calls the python script which retrieves the data from the NYT repo again. This is alright because the csv file is small in size (< 100 kb), but this type of infrastructure could cause problems in situations in which the source data is a large file.

### Design:
The design for this visualization is inspired by [these graphics](http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/) from the Wall Street Journal, which show the impact of vaccines on various infectious diseases throughout US history. Each row represents a state and each column represents a day since March 7th. I chose March 7th as the start date because the number of cases prior to that date is relatively quite small relative to the most recent numbers. The most difficult design choice I made was in making the color scale a sequential [bi-symmetric log scale](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233967063_A_bi-symmetric_log_transformation_for_wide-range_data). This is equivalent to Matplotlib's [symlogx](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/gallery/scales/symlog_demo.html) scale, and it allows the user to differentiate between low and high range values in the most intuitive fashion. I tried using linear, log, and square root scales as well, but including outlier of New York with those scales rendered the rectangles for all of the other states almost indiscernible in hue. As a result, the large values (> 40 new cases per 100,000 people) are very similar in color, while smaller values (< 25 new cases per 100,000 people) are more easily distinguished. I make use of an 8-class seqential [Yellow-Orange-Red scale](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=YlOrRd&n=8), with a light yellow hue representing few new cases per 100,000 people and dark red hue representing a large number of new cases per 100,000 people.

A concern I have is that the data might need to be aggregated weekly to reduce clutter in the future. As the disease is new and we are only looking at one month's data at the moment, a daily approach is fine, but eventually we can group the data by week so as to not have too many rectangles in the heatmap.

I also included a hover tool, implemented with [d3-tip](https://github.com/caged/d3-tip). Hovering over a rectangle with the cursor allows the user to see the following figures for the selected state and day: new cases, new cases per 100,000 people, and total cases confirmed in the state to date.

The source code for the D3 visualization can be found [here](https://github.com/dtaylor072/CoVis/blob/master/static/vis.js).
